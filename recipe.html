        <p id="tt"> ingredients:<br><b><u>For the syrup</u></b><br>
            4 green cardamom pods, lightly squashed with the side of a knife<br>
            600g caster sugar<br>
            few drops rosewater<br>
            ¼ tsp saffron strands, soaked in 2 tbsp warm water for 1 hr<br>
            2 tsp chopped pistachios<br>
          <b> <u> For the gulab jamun</u></b><br>
            6 green cardamom pods, seeds removed<br>
            1 tsp caster sugar<br>
            100g full-cream milk powder<br>
            40g plain flour<br>
            ½ tsp baking powder<br>
            50g ghee or softened unsalted butter plus 1kg ghee, for frying<br>
            1 tbsp natural yogurt<br>
            squeeze of lemon juice<br>
            4-5 tbsp whole milk<br>
            sunflower oil</p><br>
         <h id="qq"><b><u>METHODS</u></b></h> 
         <p id="qa" > <br>
            <b>STEP 1</b>
            To make the syrup, gently heat the cardamom, sugar and 500ml water in a saucepan. Don't let the water boil before the sugar has dissolved. Simmer for 10 mins, then cool.
            <br><br>
           <b> STEP 2</b>
            Gradually add the rosewater, saffron and a little of its soaking liquid until you have a subtly flavoured syrup. Set aside.
            <br><br>
           <b> STEP 3</b>
            To make the gulab jamun, use a pestle and mortar to grind together the cardamom and sugar until fine.
            <br><br>
            <b>STEP 4</b>
            Sieve the milk powder, flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl and stir in the cardamom and sugar mixture. Rub in the 50g ghee or butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
            <br><br>
            <b>STEP 5</b>
            Add the yogurt, lemon juice and enough milk to form a soft dough, taking care not to overwork the mixture.
            <br><br>
           <b> STEP 6</b>
            Oil your hands with a little sunflower oil and shape small portions of the dough into walnut-sized balls, about 3cm in diameter and 20g each. Make sure the dumplings are smooth and have no cracks or folds.
            <br><br>
           <b> STEP 7</b> 
            Reheat the syrup until it comes to the boil, then turn off the heat and cover with a lid.
            <br><br>
           <b> STEP 8</b>
            Heat the 1kg ghee in a wok or karahi to 130C or until a small piece of dough dropped in turns golden in 40 seconds. Fry the balls, in batches, over a medium heat for 5-7 mins, moving them around until they are an even, deep brown. Remove from the saucepan using a slotted spoon, then drain on kitchen paper. Add to the warm syrup, leaving them to soak for 2-3 hrs or preferably overnight.
            <br><br>
           <b>STEP 9</b> 
            When ready to eat, warm the gulab jamun through in a wide saucepan, spooning over the syrup. Serve piping hot with the pistachios scattered over.</p>
